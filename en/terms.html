Any terms and conditions on the part of the Client differing from the Terms and Conditions shall not be accepted, unless such differing conditions have been specifically negotiated and agreed in writing.

                    <br />
                    (3) Modifications and amendments of the General Terms and Conditions require the written form in order to be valid. A mutual deviation from the written form requirement shall be expressed in writing.<br />

                    (1) Tenders of the Company are always nonbinding. Unless there is no written contract, the order acceptance takes place via confirmation of order or upon actual performance. In such cases, only the content of the confirmation of order is essential for the scope of services. When no such confirmation exists, the content of the invoice is valid. If the order confirmation/ invoice differs from the contract, the agreement of the Client shall be considered given, if the latter does not object within 7 days.<br />
                    <br />
                    (2) Offers, orders or assignments by the Client are irrevocable, unless the Client has expressly declared the agreement nonbinding.<br />

                    (3) If the Company is given an order without agreement upon the costs, the Company is entitled to demand the payment corresponding to the price usually charged according to the price list or - if not available - to charge a fee based on the usual costs for such services. If the corresponding services are
                    not included in the price list, the company-standard fee shall be valid.<br />
                    <br />
                    (4) If not explicitly stated otherwise, the prices quoted exclude the legally imposed value-added tax (VAT). If the Client is a consumer within the meaning of the Austrian Consumer Protection Act (KschG), the prices are inclusive of statutory value-added tax as well as all other levies and supplements.<br />
                    <br />
                    (5) If the Client is entrepreneur, the Company is entitled to charge a higher price than agreed if there is a change of the existing current calculation basis -calculated at the moment the order was placedafter conclusion of the contract. The calculation basis includes especially the wage costs because of
                    collective agreement regulations within the sector, or internal work agreements or costs for materials, energy, transport, subcontracted works and financing. In case of change, the Company will have the right to increase the prices accordingly<br />

                    obligated for the full payment of compensation.<br />

                    (5) For the calculation deadlines, the day of the receipt of the withdrawal declaration at the Company is relevant. A delay of 14 days of the Client concerning services, especially payments or preparative services stipulated in the contract, entitles the Company either to accept the fact tacit and to demand cancellation fee, or to insist on the performance of the contract. If the Company accepts thefact tacit, the 14th day after the due time for the service in delay will be used as event setting the time running for the calculation of the cancellation fee.<br />

If it is made use of the right to withdraw declared under this section the Company is obliged to refund payments already made by the Client, and the Client has to return received services, where the costs for return must paid by the Client as agreed..<br />
                    <br />
                    (7) If the Client is a consumer, he is also entitled to withdraw from the contract or contract proposal, if his declaration of interest toward the conclusion of a consumer business (contract/order and so forth) takes neither place in the Company's permanent rooms for business purposes, nor at a fair or a stand set up at a market.
